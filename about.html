									<p>
									 AmoreSoftware is an independent company founded by Ryan Love. AmoreSoftware is a company offers wordpress site creation,
									 custom website and android application development was an Idea that I Ryan Love had for a long time. Finally in the year 2019, I have 
									 created my dream website design for me to entrepreneur my software talents. I always loved Software Development. After trying to work 
									 for others but not given much noticed, I decided to create my own company to showcase my talents and sell my software to anybody that
									 wants custom made software without the limitation that most companies will give you! Sayint all this, I am still open to working for 
									 a company so if you happen to be a owner for a software development company, please reach out to me and I will get back with you. Currently
									 ,I am going back to school to get my four year degree in Information Technology but as of now, I have an Associate Degree in Information technology
									 and AmoreSoftware is going to allow me to put everything I learned into good use!It is time to make the computing world a good place, one Desktop top at a time!
